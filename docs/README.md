 # Project Details
 ### Title 
 LaughLagoon
 ### Description 
 LaughLagoon is a satire website that changes topics every
 month. These topics will not be directly named. Part of the fun will be
 figuring out what the topic is supposed to be.
 ### Target Browsers 
 The target browsers will be Safari and Google Chrome,
 which means IOS and Android users can both view the site.
 # Developer Manual
 ### How to Install the Application and All Dependencies
 To install the application and all dependencies, download all the files
 and launch it in VS code. Then you need to install node.js and npm. To install the dependencies, look at the package.json file. Then use npm to
 install all of them.
 ### How to Run the Application On a Server
 To run the application on a server, you need to create a vercel account
 and link it to a github, that you need to create.
 ### How to Run Any Tests I Have Written
 If I do have any tests, or you need to create tests, use VS code to go live, which should take you to the website. From there right click and
 inspect element and then go to the console tab to see any bugs.
 ### The API for My Server Application
 The API for my sever application is Supabase. The GET lists all the "customers" with their first and last name and the state they are from. The POST adds "customer" first and last names and their state.
 ### Expectations Around Known Bugs
 If there are known bugs, they should be immediately fixed in a timely manner; if a bug is extremely minor and it doesn't affect the user, don't
 deal with it, unless it becomes an issue.
 ### Road-Map for Future Development.
 1. This website must stay a satire website.
 2. There needs to be clear ethical guidlines around this website.
 3. There isn't a max amount of pages for an idea, but there is a minimum of 3 pages.
 4. The css needs to be updated to make it more attractive to potential users.
 5. The domain name needs to be changed to LaughLagoon.com
 6. A team needs to be created. The team needs to be at least 69 people.
