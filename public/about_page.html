        <h1>About the Author</h1>
        <a>Edward Brown is a 
        wellness advocate and former 
        software engineer whose personal 
        transformation has inspired many. Born and raised in Milwaukee, 
        he spent much of his early life struggling with obesity,
         reaching over 380 pounds at his heaviest. 
         Despite his challenges, he built a successful career in tech, 
         known for his analytical mind and problem-solving skills. 
         But after a serious health scare in his early 30s, 
         Edward realized it was time to make a change—not just physically, 
         but mentally and emotionally. Over the course of several years, through 
         therapy, sustainable lifestyle changes, and deep personal work, he lost over 
         170 pounds and redefined his relationship with health, food, and self-worth.</a>
         
         <a>Now in his mid-30s, Edward is the founder of Reshape Forward, a wellness 
            initiative that helps others navigate weight loss and emotional healing with 
            compassion and realism. He speaks at schools, community events, and wellness 
            conferences, sharing his story to show that recovery isn’t about perfection—it’s 
            about persistence and self-connection. With a unique blend of tech savvy, humor, 
            and lived experience, Edward helps others believe that real change is possible when 
            it starts from within. He currently lives in Asheville, North Carolina, with his rescue dog, Moose, is writing a memoir titled 
            "The Weight Was Never Just the Weight.", and trying to launch an App called "NutriMotion".</a>

            <h1>The Big Idea!</h1>
            <a>Edward Brown came up with the idea for NutriMotion during the most
                challenging stretch of his weight loss journey. As he worked to
                rebuild his health, he noticed a frustrating gap in the tools
                available to people like him—those who weren’t just trying to
                count calories or hit gym goals, but who needed to build sustainable
                habits rooted in both movement and mindful eating. He found existing
                fitness apps either too rigid, overly clinical, or unmotivating.
                Most didn’t account for emotional eating, mental health, or the
                importance of small, consistent actions that feel good—not punishing.</a>

             <a>During a late-night journaling session, after a walk that helped him process
                a tough therapy session, the idea struck: what if there were an app that encouraged
                people to move intuitively and eat with intention, not perfection? He sketched
                out a rough concept that night—a flexible, supportive platform that would combine
                habit tracking, mood-based nutrition prompts, and personalized movement suggestions.
                Over time, this vision evolved into NutriMotion, an app designed to help users tune
                into their bodies, find joy in motion, and develop a healthier relationship with food
                and self, all without guilt or grind.</a>   

              <h1>The Features!</h1>
              <a>NutriMotion is an app concept Edward Brown is currently developing, inspired
                 by the emotional and behavioral gaps he experienced during his weight loss journey. 
                 The app is designed to support intuitive movement and mindful eating by meeting users 
                 where they are, emotionally and physically. Planned features include a mood-based movement 
                 planner that suggests activities like stretching, walking, or dancing based on energy level
                 and emotional state, as well as a "joyful movement" reflection tool to help users focus on
                 how they feel rather than what they achieve. On the nutrition side, Edward envisions an emotional
                 meal journal, mood-to-food prompts, and a “check-in before you eat” tool to bring awareness to
                 emotional eating without guilt or calorie counting.</a>  

               <a>To encourage sustainable habits, the app will also feature a habit loop builder for reinforcing
                  small daily routines, a mind-body dashboard to track mood, energy, sleep, and activity patterns 
                  (with optional wearable integration), and gamified self-compassion tools like kindness streaks
                  and affirmation unlocks. Users will be able to connect in peer support circles based on shared goals
                   or identities, and Edward hopes to offer optional access to certified coaches or therapists through
                    the platform. Though still in the development phase, NutriMotion aims to be more than just a tracker—it’s
                    intended to be a supportive, human-centered wellness companion that empowers users to transform not just
                    their habits, but their mindset.</a>  
                
                <h1>Will This Happen?</h1> 
                <a>Yes, it will happen, but only if I get 100,000 signups and an equal amount of signups from every state.</a>
